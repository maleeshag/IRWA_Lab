The provided code is an implementation of an inverted index, which is a data structure commonly used in information retrieval to efficiently store and retrieve information about the occurrence of terms in a collection of documents. Let's break down the code and explain its functionality:

Mounting Google Drive: The first line of code mounts the Google Drive to access files and directories stored in Google Drive.

Changing the current directory: The %cd command is used to change the current directory to the specified path, which is /content/drive/MyDrive/IRWA_lab/inverted in this case. This is the directory where the files to be indexed are located.

Getting the list of files: The os.listdir() function is used to retrieve a list of files present in the current directory (cwd). The list of files is stored in the fileList variable.

Printing the list of files: The print() statement is used to display the list of files in the current directory. This is done to verify that the correct files have been fetched.

Initializing the word dictionary: The wordDict variable is initialized as an empty dictionary. This dictionary will store the inverted index, where each term will be a key and the corresponding value will be a list of documents in which the term appears.

Building the inverted index: The code then iterates through each file in the fileList.

a. For each file, it opens the file using the open() function, reading the contents of the file.

b. The contents of the file are converted to lowercase using the .lower() method, and then split into individual words using the .split() method. This creates a list of words present in the file.

c. The code then iterates through each word in the list of words.

d. For each word, it checks if it is already present in the wordDict dictionary.

If the word is not present in wordDict, it adds the word as a key and initializes the corresponding value as a list containing the current file.
If the word is already present in wordDict, it appends the current file to the existing list of files associated with that word.
Printing the inverted index: After building the inverted index, the code prints the wordDict dictionary, which represents the inverted index. It displays each term as a key and the corresponding list of documents as the value.

Defining the invertedIndex() function: The code defines a function named invertedIndex(), which encapsulates the process of building the inverted index.

a. Within the function, a new wordDict dictionary is created.

b. The code then performs the same steps as described earlier to build the inverted index.

c. Finally, the function returns the wordDict dictionary representing the inverted index.

Calling the invertedIndex() function: The invertedIndex() function is called at the end of the code to execute the process of building the inverted index and return the result.

In summary, the code reads a collection of files from a specific directory, processes each file to extract the words, and builds an inverted index where each term is associated with a list of documents in which it appears. The invertedIndex() function encapsulates this process and returns the resulting inverted index as a dictionary.
